        WebDriverError: An error occurred while creating a new ChromeDriver session: [WebDriverError] unknown error: Chrome failed to start: exited normally.
   (unknown error: DevToolsActivePort file doesn&#39;t exist)
   (The process started from chrome location /snap/bin/chromium is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.)
  Verify if ChromeDriver is configured correctly; using:
